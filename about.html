<h1 style=font-size:200%;">My Life</h1>   
<p style="font-size:120%;">I was born in the Philippines and moved to American Samoa when I was 1. I stayed in Samoa until I was 6 but I barely remember anything about Samoa. I only remembered my friends in Samoa the hot climate. My family then moved to Hawaii because my Dad got offered a big job that pays more money and has more benefits than his job in Samoa. I attended Waikele elementary from 2nd grade until 4th grade. We moved to Waipahu after 4th grade so I attended August Ahrens for the 5th grade, then we moved to Ewa Beach after 5th grade. I attended Holomua elementary, then Ilima intermediate, then Campbell High.</p>    
     
<h2 style=font-size:200%;">Sports</h2>    
<p style="font-size:120%;">I have been playing tennis since I was 8 years old and I continued playing until I was 14. I was pretty good at tennis since I was able to practice with the varsity tennis team for campbell when I was in 8th grade. But I quit because I got bored of playing, so I decided to play soccer since I always wanted to play after watching the champions league when I was 12. I played for 3 years and I quit because I found a sport/hobby that I was more happy with. I have been weightlifting since freshman year and I have no plans of quitting. I got into weightlifting because I felt skinny during middle school so I decided to change my lifestyle.</p>    
    
<h3 style=font-size:200%;">Hobby</h3>    
<p style="font-size:120%;">My first game console was the Wii, but I did have a gameboy and the nintendo when I was 9. My family played Super Smash Bros and Need for Speed on the Wii. Then my Dad got us a Xbox 360 so we can play Call of Duty, I've been playing COD ever since. Me and my brother got tired of split screening so we saved up our own money so we can buy our own Xbox One. Now I play r6, Cod, and GTA on a regular basis.</p>    
                                    
<h4 style=font-size:200%;">Future</h4>                                    
<p style="font-size:120%;">Since I live in a Filipino house hold I have to go to college so that is one of my future plans. I loved going on airplanes since I was young so I wanted to be a pilot. But I did a intro flight during the summer and I enjoyed it but the book work was too much. There are 3 written and practical tests for each of the stages in flight:Taxi, Takeoff, and landing. Then they showed be the textbooks for each of the tests, and the flight commands I need to learn by heart. My parents also told me I still had to go to college even though a college degree is not required to be a pilot, so I lost motivation after they told me that. Now I am planning to become a physical therapists because I like exercise and my parents thought it would be good if I was in the medical field.</p>
